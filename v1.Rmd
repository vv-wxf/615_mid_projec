## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r questionarie}
# Packages to be used
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)

# install.packages("corpcor")
# install.packages("GPArotation")
# install.packages("psych")
library(corpcor);
library(GPArotation);
library(psych)

# read num data
data<-read_excel("F00007625-WV6_Data_Taiwan_2012_Excel_v20180912.xlsx")
my_data <- as_tibble(data)
data1<-data%>%select(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,24,62,106:111,161,162,163,306,307,308)
head(data1)

# Correlations between variables
raqMatrix <- cor(data1)
# head(round(raqMatrix, 2))    

# Then, run Bartlett’s test on the correlation matrix by using cortest.bartlett() from
# psych package.
cortest.bartlett(data1)

# For these data, Bartlett’s test is highly signicant,  p < .001, and
# therefore factor analysis is appropriate.
# Then, we could get the determinant:
det(raqMatrix)
# This value is greater than the necessary value of 0.00001 (see section 17.5). As such, our
# determinant does not seem problematic.

pc1 <- principal(data1, nfactors=22, rotate="none")
plot(pc1$values, type="b") 

# From the scree plot, we could nd the point of inexion (around the third point to the
# le). The evidence from the scree plot and from the eigenvalues suggests a
# fourcomponent solution may be the best.


# Redo PCA
# rerun the analysis, change nfactors = 23 to be nfactors = 4 because we now want
# only six factors.
pc2 <- principal(data1, nfactors=4, rotate="none")

# In this case, we will select oblique rotation (rotate = “oblimin”) 
# as we believe that there is correlation in the factors. 
# We will use `Ordinary Least Squared/Minres` factoring (fm = “minres”), as it is known to
# provide results similar to `Maximum Likelihood` without assuming multivariate normal distribution and
# derives solutions through iterative eigendecomposition like principal axis.

fourfactor <- fa(data1,nfactors = 4,rotate = "oblimin",fm="minres")
print(fourfactor)

print(fourfactor$loadings,cutoff = 0.3)

# The root mean square of residuals (RMSR) is 0.04. This is acceptable as this value should be closer to 0.
# Next we should check RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) index. Its value, 0.07 shows
# not good model fit as it’s beyond 0.05.

```

```{r}

fivefactor <- fa(data1,nfactors = 5,rotate = "oblimin",fm="minres")
print(fivefactor)

print(fivefactor$loadings,cutoff = 0.3)
# Next we should check RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) index. Its value, 0.066 shows
# not good model fit as it’s beyond 0.05.
```

```{r}

sixfactor <- fa(data1,nfactors = 6,rotate = "oblimin",fm="minres")
print(sixfactor)

print(sixfactor$loadings,cutoff = 0.3)
# Next we should check RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) index. Its value, 0.052 shows
# not good model fit as it’s beyond 0.05.
```

```{r}

sevenfactor <- fa(data1,nfactors = 7,rotate = "oblimin",fm="minres")
print(sevenfactor)

print(sevenfactor$loadings,cutoff = 0.3)
# Next we should check RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) index. Its value, 0.047 shows
# not good model fit as it’s beyond 0.05.
# Finally, the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) is 0.93 – an acceptable value considering it’s over 0.9.
# Hit the following to look at the factor mapping:
fa.diagram(fourfactor)
```

## Including Plots


```{r, echo=TRUE}
# change column name

tw_select_col <- colnames(data1)

tw_select_col <- str_replace_all(tw_select_col,": ","_")
tw_select_col <- str_replace_all(tw_select_col," ","_")
colnames(data1) <- tw_select_col

ggplot(data = data1) + 
    geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = V4_Important_in_life_Family,fill = V5_Important_in_life_Friends))

# view the count for question V4_Important_in_life_Family.
ggplot(data = data1) +
geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=as.factor(V4_Important_in_life_Family)))+ 
      coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,4))


# view the count for each answer of the first 4 questions together. 
testdf <- data1%>%select(1:4)%>%
    pivot_longer(cols = 1:4,names_to = "Question",values_to = "answer") %>%
    filter(answer>=0)

ggplot(testdf)+
    aes(x = answer)+
    geom_bar(position = "dodge")+facet_wrap(as.factor(testdf$Question),ncol = 2)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
